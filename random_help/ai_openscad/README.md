# Prompt

I need you to create an OpenSCAD script that generates a bottom enclosure box for my PCB.

PCB specifications:
- Dimensions: 75mm x 75mm
- Corner radius: 4mm (rounded edges)
- Mounting holes: 3mm diameter, centered 4mm from each corner

Box requirements:
- Base plate (bottom)
- Clearance: 0.5mm around the PCB
- Walls: 8mm height around the perimeter
- Mounting posts: 5mm height with 3mm high locating pins for the mounting holes

Please generate the OpenSCAD file with:
- Well-organized parameters at the top for easy customization
- All calculations done within OpenScad

Make the design fully parametric so dimensions can be easily adjusted.
